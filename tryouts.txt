[PointOfContact] - answer provided by legalCommunicator:  Based on the applicable housing laws in Brussels,
 you may be subject to eviction from your residence under certain conditions. The law stipulates that an ev
iction can only occur after a one-month notice period following a judgment or act authorizing the eviction,
 unless specific exceptions apply, such as abandonment of the property or mutual agreement on a different timeline (Art. 233undecies).

If your residence has been declared uninhabitable or is subject to a rental prohibition, you have rights th
at protect you from immediate eviction. In such cases, you are entitled to a priority access to public hous
ing managed by local authorities, and you should receive a relocation proposal at the time of eviction (Art
. 12). Furthermore, if the conditions of your rental property do not meet safety and health standards, and
this non-compliance is not your fault, you may have the option to demand necessary repairs or even terminate the lease with potential compensation for relocation costs (Art. 219).

In summary, while eviction is possible, there are significant protections and procedures in place that must be followed, which may provide you with options to avoid immediate displacement.
